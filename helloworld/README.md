#HelloWorld 

To run the go program use: 
> go run helloworld.go 

`go run` compiles the source code and runs the resulting executable file. 

If the program is more thanaone-shot exp eriment, it's likely that you wou ld want to compi le
it once and save the compi led result for later use. That is don e with go build:
> go build helloworld.go

This creates a binary file and can be run anytime with - 
> ./helloworld
